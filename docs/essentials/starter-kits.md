# Starter Kits

Instead of starting from scratch, use one of the following starter kits to get up and running quickly with Nuxt and Kirby. Depending on your needs, you can choose a minimalistic kit or a more feature-rich solution.

## üç´ Cacao Kit

The [üç´ Cacao Kit](https://github.com/johannschopplich/cacao-kit-frontend) provides a minimal but feature-rich Nuxt starter kit. It fetches content from the [üç´ Cacao Kit backend](https://github.com/johannschopplich/cacao-kit-backend), a headless Kirby instance. It is the evolved version of the Kirby Nuxt Starterkit (see below) and my best practice solution for building a Nuxt-based frontend on top of Kirby CMS.

::: info
This is the starter kit I personally recommend for most use cases.

You can harness every feature Nuxt provides to build a server-side rendered application or even pre-render the content using [Nuxt's static generation](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment#static-hosting).

Kirby's page structure is used as the source routing ‚Äì you do not need to replicate the page structure in Nuxt. This makes it easy to add new pages in Kirby without touching the frontend. All pages are rendered by the [catch-all route](https://github.com/johannschopplich/cacao-kit-frontend/blob/main/app/pages/%5B...slug%5D.vue).

A key design decision is: **Everything is a block**. All Kirby templates are designed to be block-based. This allows you to create complex pages in Kirby with a simple drag-and-drop interface. The frontend then renders these blocks in a flexible way. Of course, you do not have to stick to the block-first architecture.

If this does not appeal to you, or if you need custom Kirby page templates with custom fields, you can always create Nuxt pages and query the content using KQL. See the [`pages/about.vue`](https://github.com/johannschopplich/cacao-kit-frontend/blob/main/app/pages/about.vue) page for an example.

## Kirby Nuxt Starter Kit

The [Kirby Nuxt Starter Kit](https://github.com/johannschopplich/kirby-nuxt-starterkit) is a rewrite of the official Kirby Starter Kit with Nuxt and Nuxt Kirby. It is configured to use **token-based authentication**, but can be used with **basic authentication** as well.

::: warning
This starter kit is for educational purposes, to show how the official Kirby starter kit you know translates to the headless world. For production use, please use the [Cacao Kit](https://github.com/johannschopplich/cacao-kit-frontend) instead.

## Playground

Technically, this is not a starter, but a way to show and test all the features of this module for development. A good place to start if you want to look at the code.

Check out the [playground](https://github.com/johannschopplich/nuxt-kirby/tree/main/playground) of this module for an example Nuxt project setup.

::: tip
Run the playground locally:

1. Duplicate the `playground/.env.example` file as `playground/.env`.
2. Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm dev` to start the development server.
