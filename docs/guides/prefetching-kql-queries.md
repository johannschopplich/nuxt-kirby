# Prefetching KQL Queries

Nuxt Kirby allows you to prefetch custom queries **at build-time** (during development and in production). This is recommended for infrequently changing data to improve performance in production. You can prefetch as many queries as you like. The query results as well as their inferred TypeScript type can be imported from `#nuxt-kirby`.

To get started, add a `prefetch` object to the `kirby` configuration in your `nuxt.config.ts` file. Each key in the object represents a query that should be prefetched. The value is an object containing the actual KQL query and an optional `select` array to limit the returned fields.

```ts
// `nuxt.config.ts`
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-kirby'],

  kirby: {
    // Prefetch queries at build-time
    prefetch: {
      site: {
        query: 'site',
        select: ['title']
      }
    }
  }
})
```

When you run your dev or build command, the result of the `site` query is fetched, stored locally, and the time spent on the query(s) is logged.

```
â„¹ Prefetched site KQL query in 170ms
```

Now you can import the query result and its TypeScript type in your application:

```ts
// Import the type for the query result
import type { Site } from '#nuxt-kirby'

// Import the actual prefetched data
import { site } from '#nuxt-kirby'
```

::: info
The inferred **type** for the key will be pascal-cased, e.g. `site` becomes `Site`. If you have a query key with multiple words, e.g. `blogPosts`, the type will be `BlogPosts`.

## Multi-Language Queries

If you have a [multi-language](/guides/multi-language-sites) Kirby instance, you can specify the language for each query individually.

To only prefetch the `site` query in German, set the `language` property for the query:

```ts
// `nuxt.config.ts`
export default defineNuxtConfig({
  modules: ['nuxt-kirby'],

  kirby: {
    prefetch: {
      site: {
        // Define the KQL query and fields to select
        query: {
          query: 'site',
          select: ['title']
        },
        // Specify the language for this query
        language: 'de'
      }
    }
  }
})
```

::: info
In multi-language prefetching, note that the query to be fetched is nested inside a `query` object, while `language` is a sibling property.
